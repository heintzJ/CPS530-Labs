                    <b>Running</b>
                    <p style="width: 50pc">
                        I have been running for the past 3 years and am on the Cross Country Team at TMU.
                        I usually run 6 days a week and have team practices for 2 of them. Our first meet is coming up on
                        September 30th at Waterloo and I am very excited. We have enough people for a men's and women's
                        team this year, which we did not last year. We are at McMaster on October 13th and OUAs are October 28th.

                    <b>Reading</b>>
                    <p style="width: 50pc">
                        I enjoy reading every day and am currently reading 
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time" target="_blank">The Wheel of Time</a>.
                        Fantasy is my favourite genre, followed by Sci-Fi. I read Harry Potter when I was very young and
                        it has been one of my favourite series ever since.

                        Skiing is a lot of fun in the winter. The largest mountain I have been on is Mt. Tremblant (left),
                        but I would love to go to Europe or BC. I also enjoy watching skiing whether it's the Olympics or
                        general competitions. Ski edits are also fun to watch as they can showcase the athletes in 
                        environments not normally competed in, like urban areas.

                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <article style="width: 50pc">
                    <p>
                        I grew up on a farm outside Kitchener, Ontario. It is just a cash crop farm with no animals. There used
                        to be cows and pigs, but my grandfather sold them about 30 years ago. My elementary school only had 400
                        people and my high school had 800. So moving to the city was a big change, as I had not been around
                        so many people before.
                    </p>

                        I played soccer until I was 16 in my hometown. I really enjoyed playing it and was a referee for 3 years
                        as well. I would have like to continue playing, but COVID ruined that and not enough people were signing
                        up for teams once things started to go back to normal.
