        <p>
            Part (a) took a lot longer than Part (b). I had to figure out exactly what column sizes to use and how many
            to use. I also had to include responsive breakpoints for each of the 3 devices I decided to include. These
            were mobile, tablet, and desktop. It took much longer to get the elements to appear in the right position.
            I had to play around with different sizes and borders, and it just took too much time.

    <div class="col-xs-4">
        <h3><a href="https://cs.torontomu.ca/~jheintz/Lab3/lab03b.html">Part (b)</a></h3>
        <p>
            Part (b) was much easier with the Bootstrap framework. It automatically creates responsive breakpoints and just 
            makes the page look better. All I had to do was specify the class for each section to be <code>class="col-lg-4 col-xs-4"</code>,
            and the columns are scaled automatically, depending on the size of the window. It also appears to adjust the sizes
            of elements better, when resizing the window.
